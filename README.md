1. The eCLiPse file contains the complete website of logic puzzles that I worked out using the eCLiPse Constraint Logic program.  They were posted on Sourceforge around 1999 (under the name of brownbuffalo.sourceforge.net). When Sourceforge reorganized, the website got lost in the shuffle.  The website is a single directory with puzzle descriptions, answers and code solutions.  Install into a separate directory and run index.html in a browser.
