This project holds 

1. The eCLiPse constraint logic puzzle website pages were originally posted on Sourceforge around 1999-2000 (under brownbuffalo.sourceforge.net).  They are posted here to make them generally available to anyone.  The website is self-contained.  Install into a separate directory and run index.html in a browser.   

2. The VSIX file is replacement for the extension for VSCode of the Picat extension built by Arthur Wang (stored on Github as arthurwang.vsc-picat-9.1.21.vsix).  It modifies one line in two files so the extension works on Windows OS: extension/out/src/features/picatLinter.js  and extension/out/src/features/picatTerminal.js.  Install it as an extension into VSCode as normal.  It is not in the MS catalog, so click "install from VSIX" ( first click the  "..." at the top of the extensions area in VSCODE).   

There are no packages.  Right click and download the file(s).
