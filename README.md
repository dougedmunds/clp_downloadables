This project holds 

1. The eCLiPse file contains the complete website of logic puzzles that I worked out using the eCLiPse Constraint Logic program.  They were posted on Sourceforge around 1999 (under the name of brownbuffalo.sourceforge.net). When Sourceforge reorganized, the website got lost in the shuffle.  The website is a single directory with puzzle descriptions, answers and code solutions.  Install into a separate directory and run index.html in a browser.    

2. The VSIX file is a minor fix to the Picat extension for VSCode built by Arthur Wang.  It modifies one line in two files (dealing with Windows use of "\\" in paths) so the extension works on Windows OS: extension/out/src/features/picatLinter.js  and extension/out/src/features/picatTerminal.js.  I have left the ReadMe and other details as originally written.  It has been tested on Win 10 and 11 both in VSCode and VSCodium.  Any other issues with the extension are part of the original coding. 

To install, click on Extensions, then click the "..." at the top of the popup that opens, then select "Install from VSIX".   

There are no packages.  Right click and download the file(s) you want.
