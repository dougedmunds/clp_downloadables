This project holds 

1. The eCLiPse puzzle website pages originally posted on Sourceforge around 1999-2000.  

2. A fix to the VSIX extension for VSCode / VSCodium of the Picat extension built by Arthur Wang.  The fix modifies two files so the extension works on Windows OS (tested on Win 10 and Win 11).
